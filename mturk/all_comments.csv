367O8HRHKG8DZWK18GKEK6PF2IYS40,A13ZQSOMIZAN4Y,wheel,jet,"The second question was confusing as I'm not sure what the statement is getting at about the jet being free.  If it is talking about a purchase/transfer of the jet that doesn't cost the buyer anything, then ""the wheel must also be free"" would be the correct answer rather than I don't know."

3QI9WAYOGQBREJOFR4DTH49TY94S6L,A13ZQSOMIZAN4Y,fence,zoo,Some of the questions were a bit confusing.  Clearly a zoo cannot be human but the one about the zoo being green could have several meanings.  The facade/structures could be painted green or it could be environmentally friendly.  I took it to mean the paint on the zoo structures and that drove my answer.
